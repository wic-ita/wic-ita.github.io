<h1>Welcome to WiC-ITA</h1>

<p>
WiC-ITA is the first Word-in-Context task for Italian, organized within 
<a href="https://www.evalita.it/campaigns/evalita-2023/">Evalita 2023</a>, the 8th evaluation campaign of Natural Language Processing and Speech tools for Italian, which will be held in Parma (Italy) (7th-8th September 2023) - an initiative of the <a href="https://www.ai-lc.it/">Italian Association for Computational Linguistics (AILC)</a>.

	<li><b>The website is online</b>: November 10th, 2022</li>
	<li><b>WiC-ITA (Word in Context for Italian) at EVALITA 2023 has been accepted</b>: October 25th, 2022</li>
	</ul>

</p>


<h2>Task Description</h2>
<p>
The general goal of the WiC-ITA task is to establish if a word <i>w</i> occurring in two different sentences <i>s<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>s<sub>2</sub></i> has the same meaning or not.
In particular, our task is composed of two sub-tasks: the binary classification (Sub-task 1) and the ranking (Sub-task 2). More details about the proposed task can be found <a href="https://wic-ita.github.io/task/">here</a>.

<h1>Motivation and Background</h1>
<p align="justify">
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) (Bevilacqua et al., 2021) is a Natural Language Processing task with a long history and of extreme interest for all the Computational Linguistics community. In WSD the goal is to disambiguate each word occurrence assigning them the correct sense from a fixed sense inventory, such as WordNet (Miller, 1992). The introduction of contextualized models, such as BERT, allowing the representation of a word in different contexts, steers the research focus to new tasks, such as the Word in
Context task (WiC) (Pilehvar and Camacho-Collados, 2019).
WSD and the WiC task are highly related: while the former models in an explicit way the relationship between the target word and its sense (taken from a pre-defined sense inventory), the latter reduces it to a binary task. The WiC task requires determining if a word occurring in two different sentences has the same meaning or not. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the WiC task. This is attested by the creation of several different resources and shared tasks covering more than 20 languages, shown in Table 1.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Generally, the Word in Context task is of broad-scope interest, as it is not limited to specific domains and can be useful for several NLP tasks. Furthermore, the training and the evaluation on a monolingual (Italian) or cross-lingual (English-Italian) dataset is advantageous not only for the models for the Italian language. In fact, the transfer learning ability of WiC models across different languages is proven in previous works (Martelli et al., 2021), where models improve their performance by training in other languages. Several initiatives have been proposed throughout the years: the first one (Pilehvar and Camacho-Collados, 2019) being the proposal of the WiC task, which also came along with a dataset but was limited to English. For this reason, it was followed by the XL-WiC (Raganato et al., 2020) dataset which tried to tackle this issue by taking into account a total of 15 languages. Next the MCL-WiC (Martelli et al., 2021) was the first WiC dataset to introduce the Cross-lingual task. The main motivation behind this particular choice was to cover scenarios where systems have to deal with different languages simultaneously, further highlighting the importance of this task in real-world applications.
</p>
<p align="justify">
With AM2iCo (Liu et al., 2021) the main aim was to focus on languages with lower resources and ensure participating models must consider both the target word and the context to achieve good performances. Finally, in CoSimLex (Armendariz et al., 2020) the task is extended to pairs of words that appear in a shared context and the goal is to determine to which degree they refer to the same concept. This is done to capture polysemy as well as the context-dependency of words.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Shared tasks regarding the WiC usually preserve its binary design, where the two possible outcomes for each entry are: true if the meaning of the target word changes between the two sentences/contexts and false if it does not. However, there can be some cases where it is not so simple to determine the lack or presence of semantic similarity in a discrete way. For this reason, we exploit the 4-point relatedness scale introduced by (Schlechtweg et al., 2018; Brown, 2008) in the annotation process. The scale consists of 4 values, namely 4: Identical; 3: Closely Related; 2: Distantly Related; 1: Unrelated. A fifth value can be assigned (0: Cannot decide) for uncertain cases.
Unfortunately, as often happens in the Natural Language Processing research area, some languages are more represented than others, and the WiC task makes no exception in this sense. This issue is evident by analyzing Table 1, where only the XL-WiC dataset (Raganato et al., 2020) contains data for the Italian language. With the WiC-ITA task, we aim to help fill this gap in the literature, making openly available a resource that can undoubtedly foster novel research.
